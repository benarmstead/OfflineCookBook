- ‚è≤Ô∏è Prep time: 2-5 min
- üç≥ Cook time: 30 min

## Ingredients

Serves 2 people. You can easily scale this up by adding more additional ingredients in one big pot.

- 1/2 Red onion
- 3 cloves fresh garlic
- 1 tsp cumin
- 1 tbsp red chili powder OR 4 red chili pods
- 1 roma tomato (or any juicy tomato)
- 1 can of red kidney beans
- Your preferred cooking oil
- Salt, pepper to taste

## Directions

1. Chop the onion, garlic, and tomato.
    - Onion can be in long slices or diced.
    - Garlic is better if it's finely chopped to avoid getting big chunks in a bite.
    - Tomato can be chopped roughly. We'll be cooking it down quite a bit, so the shape doesn't matter.
2. Open the can of red kidney beans and rinse them thoroughly to drain all the preservatives. 
3. Warm a couple of tablespoons of your cooking oil in a big pot. Since the dish is primarily cooked in water, you don't need a lot of oil.
4. Once the oil is nice and hot, add your cumin and garlic. Wait until you can smell the fragrance of the garlic and hear the cumin sizzling before moving to the next step. Don't let it burn. It's better for it to be undercooked than overcooked, as the burnt taste will overpower the dish.
5. Add the chopped onion and tomato to the pot. Cook until the onions are transparent the the tomato has reduced in shape.
6. Add the red chili powder or pods. Adjust according to your spice level, but this dish is ordinarily on the spicier side!
7. Add the red kidney beans, along with one cup of water for each can. It's a good idea to salt it now so the taste is soaks in. 2-3 pinches of table salt should be good.
8. Set the pot on medium heat and let it cook for about 20 minutes.
9. Once the beans are nice and soft, your dish is ready! Serve in a bowl.

### Soaking beans

You might want to use dry beans instead of the canned ones. To do so, soak the beans overnight. Put them in a large bowl with at least double the volume of water and space so that they can expand as much as they want to. In the morning, you can start cooking them on a low flame with a bit of salt to soften them for the recipe.

Since you'll already have the beans on the stove, you might want to use two pots so that the other ingredients can be cooked separately and added to the bean mixture afterwards.
