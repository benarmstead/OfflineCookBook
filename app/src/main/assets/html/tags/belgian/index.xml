&lt;ul>
&lt;li>7 pears (Quality doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter; you can argue that overripe pears are better because they have more sugar content.)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>3 apples&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a small handful of dates, raisins, dried apricots or prunes (optional &amp;ndash; you can experiment with these; they can bring out some nice flavors.)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>150 grams sugar&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 glass of water&lt;/li>
&lt;li>find sieve or cheese cloth&lt;/li>
&lt;li>glass jar&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="directions">Directions&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Wash the outside of the fruit with water and cut it in 8 medium sized pieces. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to core or deseed the fruit; everything can go in the pot.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Place the fruit in a large pan with a thick bottom so you get even heat. I suggest you place the pears on the bottom, since they don&amp;rsquo;t burn as fast. Add the glass of water.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you are using them, add the dried fruits at this point.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Put the heat as low as possible and let it all slowly stew for 3 hours, stirring every now and then.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>At this point, you can boil your glass jars to sterilize them. Place the sterilized jars on a clean, dry towel.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When the fruit is done cooking for 3 hours, grab your sieve or cheese cloth, and place it over a bowl, run your fruit through it until you have extracted all the clear liquid. You can discard the pulp.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Quickly rinse the pot with water until clean and add the fruit liquid back. Place back on the stove.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add the sugar. Add a bit less sugar if you also used dried fruits.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cook for another 2 hours. After that, stir every so often, Be careful with the stirring; if you stir too often, it might caramelize too quickly.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>After two to two and a half hours, your syrup should be nearly done.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>At this point, it&amp;rsquo;s up to you on how thick you want your syrup to be. A good way to test the viscosity is to drop a little bit on a cold plate or on your countertop to see how it is at room temperature.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you are happy with the viscosity, pour the syrup into your sterilized jars and immediately seal them.&lt;/li>

Traditionally eaten with fries and chicory salad.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>⏲️ Prep time: 30 min&lt;/li>
&lt;li>🍳 Cook time: 2 to 4 hours&lt;/li>
&lt;li>🍽️ Servings: 4&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>2 Large onions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 tablespoon butter&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1kg chuck roast, cut in bite-sized pieces&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 33cl bottles of brown beer&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 bayleaves&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 twigs of thyme&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 clove (spice)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 tablespoons of belgian apple/pear syrup (optional, ill write up a recipe for this soon)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 teaspoons of vinegar&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 slice of bread&lt;/li>
&lt;li>mustard&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="directions">Directions&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Peel the onions and cut them into medium sized pieces, don&amp;rsquo;t cut the onion too small.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Place a large saucepan or dutch oven on low heat and add 1 tbsp butter. Once melted add your onions, cook until translucent.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>While your onions are cooking place a large frying pan on medium high heat and melt your second spoon of butter.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fry up your beef until it has a nice brown crust, to prevent overcrowding the pan you should sear the meat in separate batches, be careful to not burn the fond on the bottom of the pan.season the meat with salt and pepper while its cooking.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When a piece of beef is done searing add it to the pot with the onions, once you&amp;rsquo;re done searing all of your meat add your beer to the frying pan and use it to deglaze, scrape off all the pieces stuck to the frying pan.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add the beer you used to deglaze to the pot with the onions and beef.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add the bayleaf and thyme, optionally you can bind them together with some kitchen twine so they are easier to pick out later.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add your clove and if you have it the syrup.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Take your piece of preferably brown bread and generously spread it with mustard on both sides, place it in the sauce.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>let it simmer on low heat, stirring once every 10-15 minutes. when the sauce has reached your desired thickness place a lid on the pot.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The cooking time will depend on the quality of your meat, start checking the if your meat is done once its been simmering for about 2 hours.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The meat is done when the pieces hold together when gently stirring the sauce, but are easily cut with a fork or spoon.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Finish the sauce by gently stirring in the vinegar to brighten up the flavors and serve.&lt;/li>
